1. **Imports**: The code imports necessary libraries and modules such as `os`, `sqlite3`, `Flask`, `requests`, `datetime`, and `flask_jwt_extended`.

2. **Flask App Initialization**: Initializes a Flask application and sets up JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication.

3. **Configurations**: Defines constants for the database name, current and future VAT rates, and the date when the VAT rate changes.

4. **Database Setup**: Defines a function `init_db()` to initialize the SQLite database with two tables: `packages` and `tasks`.

5. **Endpoints**:
   - **User Login**: `/login` endpoint for user authentication.
   - **Add Package**: `/add_package` endpoint to add a new package to the database.
   - **Monitor Packages**: `/monitor_packages` endpoint to monitor packages and generate alerts if they exceed certain time limits in the warehouse.
   - **Update Package Status**: `/update_package_status/<int:package_id>` endpoint to update the status of a package.
   - **Calculate VAT**: `/calculate_vat` endpoint to calculate VAT based on the current or future rate.
   - **Optimize Route**: `/optimize_route` endpoint to optimize delivery routes using Google Maps API.

6. **Run the App**: Initializes the database and runs the Flask app on host `0.0.0.0` and port `8000`.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
